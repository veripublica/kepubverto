# Waits for every workflow run on one commit, then prints them and exits 0
# only if all succeeded. Run it in the background after the push.
#
# Usage: scripts/wait-runs.sh <commit> [expected-runs] [timeout-seconds]
#
# The release push sends main and the tag together, so one commit carries
# five runs: CI and Pages (main), crates.io, npm and binaries (the tag). The
# default expects five; a plain push to main expects 2.
#
# Written after epubsana 0.24.0, whose hand-rolled wait loop never saw its runs finish
# and sat until its 10-minute timeout, 6.5 minutes after CI was green.
